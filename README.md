# Flutter-assignment-1

My app for now displays one joke at a time thanks to following features: 
1) it uses http networking for access to api
2) for joke model json_seriazable was used

All the suggested widgets were used. Scaffold for making app-bar and separate body; SafeArea and Ppadding - for making the design of joke enjoyable (now it has space from left and right, and between Joke and Button; Column - to make text and button be on same level; 

code is formatted thanks to the command ```flutter format <<path>>```
